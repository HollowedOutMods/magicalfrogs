Monsters/Monster_theremind=Termenum
Monsters/Monster_theremind_bio=Theremind's twisted mind may be a little disturbing to those new to "Monster Biology" have had to deal with. We mean it's on your head and everyone can see it! However, you can rest assured that this brain is well protected by a thick shell that prevents injury from all kinds of somersaults and falls. Since Termenums don't walk often, it's much more efficient for them to just float!

Where the Little Termenum is, there is complete chaos. Toys fly to the sides, plates break! And now someone's lunch landed right on one of the kids' heads. But in addition to guiding the "creative" mess, smart friends have other hobbies. They love to show the audience various tricks involving disappearances, cards and animals in a hat. Despite his mischievous nature, everyone loves young Termenum.

Monsters/Monster_varrow_bio=Known for her love of hunting, Vadra's melodious cry of "Ya-ha-ha!" echoes through every corner of the Everfree Swamp. She uses her call and elongated nose to attract young Frogs to her, although this does not work as often as she would like. In fact, more often than not, her attempts scare away the slippery prey, leaving Varda without prey and in complete frog-frogdom. This is also sad because she just wants new friends to try her fresh homemade sweets.
Monsters/Monster_varrow_rare=Rare Varda
Monsters/Monster_varrow_rare_bio=What do you get when you put a needle in a nutshell, in a berry, in a cloth, then put it in a chest and bury it at the bottom of the swamp? Rare Varda, that's what! These extravagant creatures have a penchant for the mysterious and paradoxical, including themselves! It was still not possible to find out how these strange monsters appeared. And they, in turn, often appear here in different places and show off their clothes and trinkets from distant lands, giving everyone a reason to be jealous...

Monsters/Monster_wadee=Wadi Noi
Monsters/Monster_wadee_bio=Deep, deep in the darkest depths there are underwater lands lost to time. There were many different monsters living here, and currently many had risen to the surface from there. If you decide to take a dip in the misty center of Everfree Forest's swamp pools, you may hear the "humid" sound. “let's begin”, similar to the sounds of Wadi Noi, one of our studies. Although it was a beautiful fish at depth, being on land had fundamentally changed it, causing its gills to shrink, its fins to become arms, and its body to swell slightly. These changes may seem small, but they mean that Wadi Noi will no longer be able to return to its home in the deep for long. However, Wadi is kind about it and uses his glow pads to help other underwater travelers, and is a friend to many on the surface and underwater. But deep in her soul, Wadi Noi misses the beauty of her native coral reef and the melodious songs of the Crustacea Choir...

Monsters/Monster_dulsylvan_bio=A creature of wood and weathering held together by its hard core, the Carved Drevovan may seem a little rough around the edges upon first encounter. He is known to never speak and always frowns. Drevovan's perpetual bad mood should not be surprising, because his mouth has long been frozen in a sullen expression. In reality, the real 'monster' that does live in small creatures that live on the head of the silent Drevovan. These creatures, also called "trees" called, close and open holes in the branches to allow air to pass through, and give Treevans the ability to communicate with their relatives. Once the grumpy monster mystically turns into a pine cone, the Tree Wolves will quickly begin to grow and turn into new young Tree Wolves!
Monsters/Monster_dulsylvan_rare=Rare Drevovan
Monsters/Monster_dulsylvan_rare_bio=During the later stages of Drevovan's life, his body begins to change dramatically. The old hardwood is transformed into a light, airy wood known as avoce.

Although these last days are quite short, they are known to be filled with joy as old Drevovan can move freely again! But eventually all processes slow down and the juice crystallizes, holding the avoce together, and the sample freezes forever...

And you probably know who we are talking about... Of course this is the Stupa! Even more of an expert at recycling waste materials than Kongushka, she finds everything in nature to make music, but sometimes she makes some exceptions to her nature-based rule, as proven by these... pots and pans on her stupa? It's funny that she uses her 'vehicle' named in honor of myself. Or vice versa? So far, not much is known about this monster, and the Stupa itself prefers to keep its life a secret; he also skillfully guards, with his strange staff, the secrets of the swamp.

Monsters/Monster_wubbox_undof_bio=One day, while digging an underground tunnel, the Monsters came across a huge underground vault, in which they found several mysterious "Corobas" discovered. Very little is known about their origins and purpose, but a few things have been learned from observing them.\nAnalysis of samples from the surfaces of the boxes revealed that they share genetic traits with every known type of monster - and even inside there are special compartments that use a previously unknown object compression technology. The box also radiates elemental energy unknown to surface dwellers, which is an extraordinary discovery to say the least.

You don't immediately get used to the electronic chirping and whistling with which he expresses his thoughts, but over time they become close to your heart and become an integral part of the melody of the island.

When he got home, he started praising everyone for the revolutionary achievements of musical thinking: turntables, keyboards and vocoders. Using his engineering skills, Korobas integrated parts of the technologies he discovered into himself, forever changing both his appearance and his song - completing his transformation into Rare Korobas.

Some Wublins are more resistant to this effect and jokingly warn the Wormpleaser that it is not good to do so.

Depending on the environment, Whistler may wear armor of a different material to suit his current needs. Sometimes they earn extra money as a kind of 'vacuum cleaners'. to clean up the dirt that other monster friends bring with them.

Monsters/Knott_1=Tree uncertain
Monsters/Knott_1_bio=This creature, even though it doesn't look like a tree, is a "graft". This species is the next stage in the evolution of insecure trees, conifers that grow all over the island. The bark is very hard and impenetrable to most parasites and predators. In a certain species "Nymph-Carver" developed strong teeth that can bite off rocky bark and burrow inside. The tree bark resonates wonderfully from within. This allows the nymphs to sing inside, producing a deep, throaty, high-pitched sound. The holes cut by the nymphs resemble a face to ward off unwanted guests and also to participate in the annual Ghosttail costume contest.

As we stopped to explore, our bonbon finally realized that here was his new home, one he had been looking for for millennia! However, the island's magic influenced him greatly.

Goldenduck is the closest thing to his heart of stone. You can see him constantly humming something softly until it's his turn to sing. If Tuzzpik had had his way, he would have left his native island. But most likely, this would again lead him to the state of an unreasonable rock. Well... unless of course he took one of the sources of magic with him.

While we still don't know exactly how it works, the mist seems to give Harmoness the power to create melodic sounds that resonate everywhere. The enchanting melody can be heard throughout the forest, thanks to Flora's mist. In fact, this was the first thing the nature monsters heard when they arrived in the Deep Forest. They also say that Garmonessy has a common family member with Zelynka and Puzayets. ..... What? How did you get this sample? Hmm... Excuse me. "Magical Expansion" is not canon.

Hound created incredible creations such as "Giaconda Mona Lisa", "Black Square", "3 Bears" and others, he himself designed and built the Statue of Liberty and the Eiffel Tower. The dog has been repeatedly found in many historical events. He is a veteran of World War II and is very proud of this title. He wrote the first book, opened the Olympic Games and was a jury member there. What about the Olympic Games, Hound was founded by Rome itself! He invented the wheel and taught people how to make tools. And most importantly, thanks to the Hound, people got fire. Everyone says man tamed the wolf, but that's not true! In effect, the Dog tamed the man and convinced him that his relatives were not his enemies. They say it was because of him that big explosion happened when he accidentally sneezed. This dog has a very rich history. And you know, if I were you, I'd be afraid of him...



STRUCTURES

When the work was completed, there was no longer any doubt: this is the most beautiful place in the world where monsters can live. Welcome to paradise!
Structures/Structure_castle_undof8=Crytilium Palace
Structures/Structure_castle_undof8_bio=Even rarer than the rarest minerals of the core dimension, crystallium was the very first crystal ever created, a byproduct of the giants' tampering with the bell. So the deposits only exist in a pocket size. Coincidentally, this substance has the ability to transfer knowledge about how to work with it to everyone who comes into contact with it. It is this ability that allows the inhabitants of the pocket dimension to effortlessly build crystallium palaces with more spaces than ever before, and it is used in conjunction with the Fire Crystal for which it served as a model.

"Valuable juices" The eggs, more like spores, slowly flow through the double drains and magically mix in the central vessel, where a new egg is created! The process is not that simple, because one combination for crossing can produce different results.
